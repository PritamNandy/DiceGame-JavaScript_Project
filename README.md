# DiceGame-JavaScript_Project
This is a javascript project that I developed. Thanks to Jonas Schmedtmann. I took this game idea from his udemy project and also build it as a Challenge coding practice.

Basic Idea and Feature of this game:
There are two players. Each player will role the dice until he wants. Each dice value will be added into his current score. But If dice value comes 1 then all his current value will be 0 and next player will start playing.
So how a player can get his current values into his global score so he/she can win the game. Player can press hold button whenever he want to pass the game so all his current value will be added into his global point.
Suppose A player's GLOBAL POINT is 12. He roled the dice for 3 times and each turns values are 3,4,6 so current value will be 13. If player press hold button his current value will be added with his global value so player's score will be
25. Pressing hold button will pass the game to opposite player. First player who achieve 50 point win the game. BINGO!!!!!
