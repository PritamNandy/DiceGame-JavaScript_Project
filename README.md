# DiceGame-JavaScript_Project
This is a javascript project that I developed. Thanks to Jonas Schmedtmann. I took this game idea from his udemy project and also build it as a Challenge coding practice.

Basic Idea and Feature of this game:

There will be two players. Each player can roll the dice until he wants. Each dice value will be added to his current score. But If the dice value comes 1 then all his current value will be 0 and the next player will start playing.
So how a player can get his current values into his global score so he/she can win the game. Player can press the hold button whenever he wants to pass the game so all his current value will be added to his global point.
Suppose A player's GLOBAL POINT is 12. He rolled the dice 3 times and each turns values are 3,4,6 so the current value will be 13. If the player press hold button his current value will be added with his global value so the player's score will be
25. Pressing the hold button will pass the game to the opposite player. The first player who achieves 50 points wins the game. BINGO!!!!!
